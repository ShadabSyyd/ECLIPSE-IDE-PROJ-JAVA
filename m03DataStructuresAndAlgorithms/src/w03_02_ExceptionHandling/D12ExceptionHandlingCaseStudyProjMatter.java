Object Oriented Design for a Property Rental Management System

Problem statement:
As the industrialization goes global, people move between different cities in search of better job and lifestyle prospects. 
Buying a new home in every city is neither possible or practical for them, so renting an apartment or a house becomes a default 
choice of accommodation these days. 
Not only these are affordable, but are very flexible option for the people who keep moving after every few years.

Understanding that this can turn out into the next Unicorn startup, 
you have decided to have your own setup around this same idea. 
You are planning to build this Property Rental Management system.

We will focus on the following set of requirements:

1. Your property rental company should rent following categories of properties
 a Apartments 
 b.RowHouse

2. Resident can rent a type of property from the list of available rental properties with rental company, 
and pay the monthly rent as agreed with the parties and become a tenant of that property. 
If there no available rental property, the system shall give an error message to the user.

3. Tenants can vacate the property either at the end of the lease or earlier 
by giving 1 month notice period to the company by clearing all rental dues till date

4. Your system should not allow one tenant to be assigned to multiple properties, 
though multiple tenants can be assigned to a single property.

5. Move in date and Move out date cannot be left empty while creating the lease.

6. Move in date cannot be after the move out date.

7. Every property will also have an associate property tax levied by municipal corporation.
